- Create LiveCD on a USB drive using either dd (from linux) or liveusb-creator

- Click "Install to Hard Drive"
- Select your language, then click Continue.
- Set up Timezone, Install Disks, Keyboard, and Networking/Hostname
- Click "Begin Installation"
- While the installer is copying software, configure the root password and add the initial
  user by clicking on the corresponding icons.
- When installation is complete, you must click the "Quit" button to exit the installer.
  You must then reboot the machine by going to the top-right corner, clicking on
  Desktop->Leave, then selecting Reboot.  Be sure to remove the USB stick with the Live CD
  first!

- Reboot, and login with your username/password.
- I don't like the "Desktop Folder" in KDE, so I use the X to delete it from the desktop
- Go to the lower-left "F" icon (for Fedora), select Favorites->Software Management, click
  Updates->Check for New Updates.  Install any detected.
- From now on, sequences like Fedora -> Favorites -> System Settings will be truncated to
  just "System Settings"
- System Settings -> Window Behavior -> Window Behavior -> Focus
    Select "Focus Follows Mouse - Mouse Precedence" (about 60% position)
    Set "Delay Focus" to 100 ms or less (I don't like delays!)

- Add yourself to the sudoers file:
    1. Become root
    2. visudo   # edits the /etc/sudoers using vim
    3. Add a line like "alan ALL=(ALL) ALL"         # e.g. for user 'alan'
    4. You can now act like root via the 'sudo' command
    5. Test using a command like "sudo date".  Enter your normal password (e.g. the 'alan'
    password), and it should work.

- Start the native browser Konqueror. Do a Google search for "Google Chrome", download the
  64-bit *.rpm file and install it using the native installer "apper".  Fire it up and
  make the default browser.

- Install basic software using yum:
    1. sudo yum install -y vim gvim             # install 'vim' and 'gvim', answering 'Yes' to all prompts
    2. sudo yum install -y git

To Do:
  Configure cool dir (dotfiles)
  Install software from list
  Configure 2nd disk (not showing up yet)
