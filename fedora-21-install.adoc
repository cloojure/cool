- Click "Install to Hard Drive"
- Select your language, then click Continue.
- Set up Timezone, Install Disks, Keyboard, and Networking/Hostname
- Click "Begin Installation"
- While the installer is copying software, configure the root password and add the initial
  user by clicking on the corresponding icons.
- When installation is complete, you must click the "Quit" button to exit the installer.
  You must then reboot the machine by going to the top-right corner, clicking on
  Desktop->Leave, then selecting Reboot.  Be sure to remove the USB stick with the Live CD
  first!

- Reboot, and login with your username/password.
- I don't like the "Desktop Folder" in KDE, so I use the X to delete it from the desktop
- Go to the lower-left "F" icon (for Fedora), select Favorites->Software Management, click
  Updates->Check for New Updates.  Install any detected.
- From now on, sequences like Fedora -> Favorites -> System Settings will be truncated to
  just "System Settings"
- System Settings -> Window Behavior -> Window Behavior -> Focus
    Select "Focus Follows Mouse - Mouse Precedence" (about 60% position)
    Set "Delay Focus" to 100 ms or less (I don't like delays!)
