- Create LiveCD on a USB drive using either dd (from linux) or liveusb-creator
  - Nothing appears.  Power cycle & start over
  - Select "Troubleshooting"
    -> Select "Begin in Basic Graphics Mode"

- Click "Install to Hard Drive"
- Select your language, then click Continue.
- Set up Timezone, Install Disks, Keyboard, and Networking/Hostname
- Click "Begin Installation"
- While the installer is copying software, configure the root password and add the initial
  user by clicking on the corresponding icons.  Be sure to check "Make Administrator".
  This allows you to install software, etc using your local password instead of the root
  password.
- When installation is complete, you must click the "Quit" button to exit the installer.
  You must then reboot the machine by going to the top-right corner, clicking on
  Desktop->Leave, then selecting Reboot.  Be sure to remove the USB stick with the Live CD
  first!
- Reboot, and login with your username/password.
  - I don't like the "Desktop Folder" in KDE, so I use the X to delete it from the desktop

My computer has an NVidea card (EVGA brand).  At install or upgrade, Linux sometimes
doesn't work correctly with the card and instead reverts to using the built-in graphics.  
  - You should keep a VGA cable plugged into the computer and connected to the VGA input
    port of a monitor.  If the computer boots to a blank screen, switch the monitor to the
    VGA input until you (re-)install the latest linux driver from the NVidia website.

To boot into console (text) mode (no GUI), wait until the boot screen comes up.  The word
"Ubuntu" will be highlight during a 10 sec countdown.  
  - Use the up/down arrow keys to stop the countdown. Hightlight "Ubuntu"
  - Type "e" to Edit the command
  - Find the words "quiet splash" in a command near the bottom
  - Using the arrow keys and backspace, change "quiet splash" -> "text"
  - Continue boot using either Crtl-X or F10

When performing an OS install or other significant OS upgrade, the video card may quit
working altogether. Since the video card is typically connected to the monitor using HDMI,
DisplayPort, or DVI ports/cables, this will leave you puzzled & staring at a blank screen.
In that case, you must connect the built-in video out (e.g. VGA/DSub) to the monitor so
that you can (re-)install the video driver.

The following doesn't seem to work (blank screen):
  In Ubuntu, single-user console is "runlevel" 1:  sudo telinit 1

- Start the native browser Konqueror. Do a Google search for "Google Chrome", download the
  64-bit *.rpm file and install it using the native installer "apper".  Fire it up and
  make the default browser.
  - When it asks about KDE Wallet System, select "blowfish". Enter a simple password.
  - For some reason, it sometimes gives you the *.deb file instead of the required *.rpm
    file even when Fedora is selected.  If so, the install will fail.  Try again & it'll
    probably work (give the *.rpm file)

- Install NVidia Drivers
  - NVidia drivers require the package "kernel-devel" from Fedora.  Install it using
    Software Management -> Installed Software.  Search for "kernel", select
    kernel-devel & kernel-debug.  Install.  
  - Also install gcc:  sudo yum install -y gcc (or graphical)
  - You must reboot at this point so the kernel-devel stuff is visible.
  - Download latest from NVidia Linux site (google it). I prefer the "short lived" branch
    as it has all of the newest stuff.
  - You must install from the console, runlevel 3 (single-user mode):  "sudo init 3"
  - Go to the download dir, and type "sudo /bin/bash NVIDIA-Linux-X86_64-XXX.YY.run" where
    setting XXX.YY to match your download.

- Skype no longer seems to work on Fedora 20/21.  It will fail (seg fault) due to 32-bit
  vs 64-bit conflicts. It used to work on F20, so I don't know why it won't anymore.

- If you fail to check "Make Administrator", you won't be able to use sudo. You will have
  to add yourself to the sudoers file:
    1. Become root
    2. visudo   # edits the /etc/sudoers using vim
    3. Add a line like "alan ALL=(ALL) ALL"         # e.g. for user 'alan'
    4. You can now act like root via the 'sudo' command
    5. Test using a command like "sudo date".  Enter your normal password (e.g. the 'alan'
    password), and it should work.
