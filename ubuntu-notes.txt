My computer has an NVidea card (EVGA brand).  At install or upgrade, Linux sometimes doesn't work
  correctly with the card and instead reverts to using the built-in graphics.  You should keep a VGA
  cable plugged into the computer and connected to the VGA input port of a monitor.  If the computer
  boots to a blank screen, switch the monitor to the VGA input until you enable proprietary drivers
  via "System Settings" (NOT from the NVidia website).

To boot into console (text) mode (no GUI), wait until the boot screen comes up.  The word
"Ubuntu" will be highlight during a 10 sec countdown.  
  - Use the up/down arrow keys to stop the countdown. Hightlight "Ubuntu"
  - Type "e" to Edit the command
  - Find the words "quiet splash" in a command near the bottom
  - Using the arrow keys and backspace, change "quiet splash" -> "text"
  - Continue boot using either Crtl-X or F10

When performing an OS install or other significant OS upgrade, the video card may quit
working altogether. Since the video card is typically connected to the monitor using HDMI,
DisplayPort, or DVI ports/cables, this will leave you puzzled & staring at a blank screen.
In that case, you must connect the built-in video out (e.g. VGA/DSub) to the monitor so
that you can (re-)install the video driver.

The following doesn't seem to work (blank screen):
  In Ubuntu, single-user console is "runlevel" 1:  sudo telinit 1

  Did you install Unity with the CompizConfig Settings Manager? You can download it with sudo apt-get
    install compizconfig-settings-manager. Then launch with ccsm. Click the desktop section on the left
    then Unity plugin, use the filter to find "Edge Stop Velocity" and set it to 0.
  For those that googled this answer looking for how to disable Window sticky edges. Type ccsm (to
    install sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager) and filter by edge. Go to Snapping
    Windows > Behavior > Snap Type and uncheck Edge resistance and Edge attraction.

Turning Wi-Fi network devices on/off:  http://askubuntu.com/questions/168032/how-to-disable-built-in-wifi-and-use-only-usb-wifi-card
  I think the most easy way to do this is with ifconfig. Run
      ifconfig
    then look at which adapter you want to turn off, in my case wlan1 is my internal wifi and wlan2 is
    my usb wifi. Then run
      sudo ifconfig wlan1 down
    and it will turn of (type ifconfig to check, note that in the network manager the adapter still
    shows, but it is turned of). To turn it on again:
      sudo ifconfig wlan1 up
    and that's it.
  (Alan) Go to System Settings -> Network -> Wireless, the find your network name and click the ">"
    (greater-than symbol) at the far right edge. Then click "Settings" in the lower-right corner, and
    ensure the "Wi-Fi" tab is selected. The line "Device MAC address" will show both the h/w address
    and the network name (in parentheses). The network name is the same as that shown by ifconfig.
    On my computer, the built-in wifi card is "wlp4s0" and the USB wifi device is "wlx803f5d22051b".
  (Alan) Actually, the above seems to reconnect. Look at the detail page in System Settings -> Network.
    Instead of Wi-Fi tab, go to General tab and uncheck Automatically connect to this network when it is
    available, as well as the All users may connect.... This seems to keep the built-in card from
    connecting to wifi. 
  The top-rated answer suggests:
    Add the following line to /etc/network/interfaces:
      iface wlan0 inet manual
    NetworkManager doesn't manage interfaces configured in the interfaces file. Replace wlan0 with the interface 
    you want to disable, if it's not the name of the built-in interface.  Then restart network manager:
      sudo service network-manager restart

octave notes (old 2014):
  ==> Caveats

  To use the gnuplot plotting engine, you must set the environment
  variable GNUTERM. Valid choices include:
      GNUTERM=x11   # X windows must be installed
      GNUTERM=qt    # gnuplot must have been compiled with Qt support
      GNUTERM=aqua  # if you are using Aquaterm
  You may also set this variable from within Octave with the command
      setenv('GNUTERM','qt') % or 'x11', or 'aqua'

  The Octave GUI is experimental and not enabled by default. To use it,
  use the command-line argument "--force-gui"; e.g.,
      octave --force-gui

Old Stuff Below....

- Install NVidia Drivers (old Kubuntu)
  - NVidia drivers require the package "kernel-devel" from Fedora.  Install it using
    Software Management -> Installed Software.  Search for "kernel", select
    kernel-devel & kernel-debug.  Install.  
  - Also install gcc:  sudo yum install -y gcc (or graphical)
  - You must reboot at this point so the kernel-devel stuff is visible.
  - Download latest from NVidia Linux site (google it). I prefer the "short lived" branch
    as it has all of the newest stuff.
  - You must install from the console, runlevel 3 (single-user mode):  "sudo init 3"
  - Go to the download dir, and type "sudo /bin/bash NVIDIA-Linux-X86_64-XXX.YY.run" where
    setting XXX.YY to match your download.

- Start the native browser Konqueror. Do a Google search for "Google Chrome", download the
  64-bit *.rpm file and install it using the native installer "apper".  Fire it up and
  make the default browser.
  - When it asks about KDE Wallet System, select "blowfish". Enter a simple password.
  - For some reason, it sometimes gives you the *.deb file instead of the required *.rpm
    file even when Fedora is selected.  If so, the install will fail.  Try again & it'll
    probably work (give the *.rpm file)

- Skype no longer seems to work on Fedora 20/21.  It will fail (seg fault) due to 32-bit
  vs 64-bit conflicts. It used to work on F20, so I don't know why it won't anymore.

- For Oracle client on AWS we need:
  sudo apt install -y libaio1         - async I/O (note can use "apt search libaio")
  sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient12.1-basic-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm
  sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm
  sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm
    See:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Oracle%20Instant%20Client

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NVidia Driver Upgrade (old 2014; Fedora?)
  Regardless of card brand (e.g. EVGA), go to the NVidia Linux Driver site (google it)
  Download the newest (short-lived-branch) driver. It is a (Bourne) shell script.
  Send the machine into single-user mode (like old runlevel=3):  "sudo init 3".  Login again.
  Go to the download dir, and execute "sudo /bin/bash NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-XXX.YY.run" 
    (need to be root to install)
  Use arrow keys to highlight "Accept" and then hit <ret>
  On my new Fedora 21 installation, it says I need the "kernel-devel" (or "kernel-source")
    RPM installed.  So, switch back to multi-user mode ("sudo init 5") and use regular
    software update to install "kernel-devel" RPM.
  OK, "kernel-devel" RPM is installed. Switch back to single-user mode ("sudo init 3"),
    and repeat "sudo /bin/bash NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-XXX.YY.run".  This time it works. I
    answer "yes" to "Install 32-bit libs?" question (probably unnecessary).
  Select "yes" to nvidia-xconfig question.
  "Driver installation completed" message is displayed.  Click "OK".
  Reboot machine "sudo reboot"
  Both displays are now working!
