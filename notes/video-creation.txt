If already have an ISO image:

  use ubuntu launcher for:  brasero  (disk burner)

    -> burn image (existing cd/dvd image to disc)
    -> insert blank dvd in drive
    -> select iso image file as source
    -> can use default properties ("maximum speed" vs 16x or 8x)  
            reports effective speed ~9x on my machine => ~10 min to burn
