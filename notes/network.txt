  So VPN Pulse Secure just died and killed my network config in the process. It hosed /etc/resolv.conf
  which is required for DNS to work, causing google.com (& the rest of the world) to become
  unreachable.  Thankfully I had a second computer and could search for network diagnostic tips.
  StackExchange was a lifesaver.  Also, it would appear that this is what killed my computer on
  Friday.

  It is normally a symlink like:  
      root root 29 Oct 30 15:41 /etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf﻿⁠⁠⁠⁠

  When you run PulseSecure, it deletes the symlink and replaces it with a file:

    > cat /etc/resolv.conf
    search brocade.com corp.brocade.com englab.brocade.com
    nameserver 10.70.20.23
    nameserver 10.70.20.43

  If PulseSecure exits normally, it replaces the symlink.  If it crashes, you are left with a hosed
  computer and no DNS and no connection to anything. (edited)

  diagnose with 'dig' tool, get no DNS responses
     > dig
    ; <<>> DiG 9.10.3-P4-Ubuntu <<>>
    ;; global options: +cmd
    ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
