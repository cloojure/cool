VirtualBox Shared Folders:

  in gui:  Devices -> Shared Folders -> Shared Folder Settings
  click on "plus folder" icon near top right edge
  in pop-up window:  Folder Path -> Other (dropdown menu) -> find existing host folder -> "Choose" button
    Example:    select a pre-existing host folder like "/home/joe/sample" 
                "Folder Name" field is populated with "sample"
  select both "Auto-mount" and "Make Permanent" checkboxes
  select "Read-Only" checkbox if desired (i.e. guest cannot write to host)
  click "OK" button

  *** Restart the VM to make it auto-mount the folder ***

  folder "sample" is now visible as /media/sf_sample, owned by user "root" & group "vboxsf"
    this cannot be changed by "chown" or "chmod", it seems

  to facility access, you must append group "vboxsf" to list of groups for user "joe"
    sudo usermod -aG vboxsf joe
  User "joe" must not log out & back in for new permissions to take effect

  now you can use ls, cd, etc:
    ls -al  /media/sf_sample
    cd      /media/sf_sample
    date >  /media/sf_sample/tmp.txt
    cat  >  /media/sf_sample/tmp.txt
