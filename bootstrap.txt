Design notes:

RT = "Right Touch" processing s/w
  Includes GUI for agents to talk w. customers
  Records events (incl chat transcript) to text log files as pseudo-URI strings (long lines)

DW = "Data Warehouse"
  Runs under Hadoop
  Reads events from log files & processes to generate metrics for analysis & reporting
  "Exporter" = dw/**/TranscriptProcessor.java
    Writes out data to disk that will later be loaded into Solr

HTAPI = "Historical Transcript" API
  Loads chat/transcript info from disk (DW output) into Solr
  "Loader" is actually named htapi/**/EngagementLoader.java

Installation & Config notes:

IT-related help is accessed by sending email to: help@touchcommerce.com

Work with IT support & the NOC as necessary to get your username/password set
up for OpenOffice (Office365.com), Stash/JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo, and
ADP.

Install & log into your account for Outlook email.  Make sure you can access the Outlook 
webmail at outlook.office.com (or office365.com -> sign-in -> for work)

In the Control Panel, update the power options so that the computer will not
sleep or shutdown for at least 4 hours when plugged in.  You may also wish to
set the screen saver time to something in the range of 30 min to 2 hours.

Download & install Chrome. Make it your default browser. Go into
Settings->Appearance & check "Always show the bookmarks bar".

Open the webpage jira.touchcommerce.com. Start to create a bookmark by typing
CTRL-D, then click the "Edit" button. Highlight the "Bookmarks bar" line and
click the "New Folder" button, label the folder "TC", then click "Save".
Using the "menu" button at the top left (3 horizontal bars), visit home pages
for Confluence, Stash, & Bamboo. For each of them, make a bookmark (^D) and
save it in the TC folder.

As you visit new webpages, make additional bookmarks for all the important
ones (ADP, Portal, etc). When in doubt, bookmark it - you can always delete
unneed bookmarks later.

Download & install Cygwin.  During install, when you get to the page that
shows components to install, click the "circle arrows" exactly once. Wait a
second or 2 until the word "Default" changes to "Install", then proceed with
the installation.  It will take 5-10 hours to download & install everything,
so let run in the background or overnight if necessary.

Download & install Windows VIM (vim.org). The one supplied with Cygwin doesn't
work so well on Windows.

If you wish, you can install Git separately from the one supplied with Cygwin
(http://git-scm.com/download/win).  I prefer to just use the cygwin version to
avoid having to maintain multiple environments & configurations (different
home directories, dot-files, etc).

Check that git is working:  git --version

	If your development environment is windows and you are working under
	RT development repo, please read below.

	If you’re programming on Windows environment you will run into
	line-ending issues.  This is because Windows uses both a carriage-return
	character and a linefeed character for newlines in its files,  whereas Mac and
	Linux systems use only the linefeed character.  In order to maintain the
	homogeneity for RT development repo across all environments:

	1.	Check that you have the autocrlf GIT setting set to true by 
                  executing : git config  --global --edit 
	2.	Please run : git config --global core.autocrlf  true, if you never set
	          this property before.

Download & install IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate version). Get the license key from
IT support & install it.  You can use the same license key to install IntelliJ
on both home & work computers.

Make sure that "Skype for Business" is installed and you can login.  This is
different from plain Skype. It used to be named "Lync".

Go to stash.touchcommerce.com. Bookmark this page in your TC folder.  Click on
the RightTouch project, then the DW (DataWarehouse) repository. Under the
ellipsis icon ("...") near the top-left, click the Clone link and copy the git
URL or the repo.  Go to the terminal and clone the project like:

   > git clone ssh://git@stash.touchcommerce.com:7999/rt/dw.git

(or use IntelliJ).

At the stash webpage, use the top-left menu bar (3 horizontal lines) to switch
to JIRA and Confluence (named "TouchCommerce Wiki") and bookmark those as well
under the TC folder.

Bookmark https://touchcommerce.timetask.com and use it to record daily time. Submit weelky
timesheets once they are completed.

Building/Running

  TC has a modified version of Maven that is in the Stash git repo.  Clone this repo and use this
  maven version.

  In a newly checked-out repo, go to the top level of the directory and type 

    # mvn clean ; mvn install   # more reliable than "mvn clean install"

  which will download jar file dependencies and compile the project. Note that "mvn test" should
  work but is broken in DW (#todo fix this).
